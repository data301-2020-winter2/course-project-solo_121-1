## Research Q1: Does the factor of smoking have a poisitive effect or negative effect on the medical charges of these patients?

In graph number 3 it is clearly shown in the graph that the lower number of charges cost are those of patients that do not participate in smoking. Although some non-smokers have higher charges and some smokers have lower charges than some non-smokers. From charges of 400000 and up the only patients that have these due balances are those that are smokers. From the graph you can say that those that are smokers have a higher probabilty of racking up greater hospital services which lead to the greater medical charges.
-In graph 5 the smoking factor does not necessarily have an effect on the patients BMI but, it is still evident that the presence of smoking very much has an effect of charges where it raises the cost that patients will evidently have to pay.

## Research Q2: Wnat is the difference between males and females when it comes to the charge of medical expenses?

In graph 6 the x-axis is representing the age, y-axis is representing the cost while the graph has seperated the defference between the males and females. On the graph for each charges area or small range, the existence of male and female patients are roughly equal to each other. In other words they co-exist equally around each charges value. On the sides pf the graph the visulas represent the density around around a certain area and for the charges part the male and female have the same shape insinuating that the male and female were equal.
